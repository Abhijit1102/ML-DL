    "**Why we choose sample over population**\n",
    "- Cost: Collecting data from a large population can be expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. Sampling allows researchers to study a smaller, more manageable subset of the population, reducing the cost and effort involved in collecting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time: Collecting data from an entire population can also take a long time, especially if the population is large or spread out over a large geographical area. Sampling allows researchers to collect data more quickly, so that they can make quicker decisions or take action based on their findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feasibility: In some cases, it may be impossible or unethical to collect data from the entire population. For example, if the population includes sensitive information or is difficult to access, researchers may need to use sampling techniques to collect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accurate results: A well-designed sample can still provide accurate results that are representative of the entire population. This is because, when properly designed, samples can be selected in a way that minimizes the chance of bias and maximizes the chances of getting a good representation of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, choosing to study a sample instead of the entire population can be a practical and effective way to gather information about a population and make inferences about it. However, it's important to ensure that the sample is representative of the population, so that the results obtained from the sample can be extrapolated to the population as a whole."

    "**Covariance** is a measure of the association between two random variables. It provides information about the direction and strength of the relationship between two variables, and it's often used to describe the spread or dispersion of a set of data points. The covariance between two variables is calculated as the average of the products of the deviations of each variable from its mean. A positive covariance means that the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance means that they tend to move in opposite directions. If the covariance is zero, it means that there is no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
