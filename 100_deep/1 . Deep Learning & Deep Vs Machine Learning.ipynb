    "- Deep learning is board family of machine learning methods based on Artifical Neural Newtorks with representation learning.\n",
    "- Note: Feature learning or representation learning is aset of technique that allows a system to automatically repesentation need for feature detection and classification from raw data.\n",
    "- Deep Learning algorithm use multiple layer to progressively extract high-level features from the raw input.\n",
    "- For Example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layer may identifly the concept relevant to human such asdigit, letter or face."

For Labeling Big tech giant like Google, Microsoft Label the data set by publicing the Dataset. Example, for image data set Microsoft coco, text data squad from wikipedia, Audio of google Audios.\n",
    "- Secondly Hardware, According to Morse law, cheaper processing cost. Deep Learning need powerful matrix operation which are used in GPU(RTX) which reduce 10-20 times than CPU by parallel processing, further FPGA but they are expensive, ASIC Application Specific Integrated surface, TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) Of google, EDGE-TPU for Drone and smart watch, NPU(Neutral processing units) in mobile device.\n",
    "- Thirdly frame work and libraries, Two famous libraies In 2015 tensorflow by google, pytorch by facebook. As tensorflow has very difficult google introduce keras which is intermediate used. In AI research pyTorch is used, facebook 2018 caffee used in sever, so google made complete frame work\n",

Example: image classification - Resnet, Text classification - BERG, Object ditection - YONO, spech rekignation -Wavenet.\n",
